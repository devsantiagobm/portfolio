These skills include layout design, creating responsive interfaces, implementing logic, managing application state, continuous maintenance, and consistently adding value to a product.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to emphasize that my capability as a developer also extends to both back-end and front-end development. In the back-end realm, I am proficient in managing REST APIs, user authentication, file manipulation, and other essential functionalities. My back-end focus encompasses skills in technologies such as Laravel and Node.js, along with the use of databases like MySQL and MongoDB.\n\nWhile words can express a lot, I believe that a project speaks even louder. Therefore, I invite you to explore my work and witness firsthand how I've applied my skills across diverse projects.\n\nThis holistic approach, encompassing both front-end and back-end domains, enables me to provide comprehensive and valuable solutions at every stage of development."
