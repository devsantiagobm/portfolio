        "why_develop_text": "During my early days in development I didn't know what I should learn, what path to follow or what I should do in general. Because of this, I had to learn something as important as development: search. \n\nI consider that this, although it sounds so basic and unimportant, is the basis of why today I have the skills I have. During my almost 3 years of learning, searching and researching has been the basis of my knowledge, either in courses, documentation and even books",

        "what_i_build_text": "My strongest skills as a developer are the ones a front end developer works on. \n\nAmong them I could mention layout, creating responsive interfaces, implementing logic, managing the state of an application, maintenance and above all the constant creation of value in a product. \n\nBut since a project says more than a thousand words,I invite you to visit my projects"
